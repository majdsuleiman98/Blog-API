### Project Overview

This project leverages the Express.js framework to build a robust RESTful API for a Blog application. Users can seamlessly log in, create and manage their posts, edit their profiles, engage with the community by writing comments, and like other users' posts. 
Additionally, I integrated the Cloudinary API for efficient image upload and storage on an online server, ensuring that all media assets are handled securely and efficiently.
